## Functionality

The code performs various analyses on the sales data, including:

## Data Exploration:

Identifies the unique values in specific columns (city, product line, customer type, payment method).
Calculates basic statistics like average sales quantity, average rating, etc.

## Sales Analysis:

Analyzes sales performance by factors like time of day, day of week, product line, customer type, and branch.
Calculates total revenue by month.
Identifies the product lines with the highest revenue and VAT.
Compares sales performance across different branches and customer types.

## Customer Analysis:

Identifies the most common customer types and payment methods.
Analyzes customer behavior based on gender and purchase time.

## Code Structure
The code consists of several SQL queries that achieve specific analysis tasks.

## Initial Queries:

Selects all data from the sales table.
Creates new columns for time_of_day, day_name, and month_name derived from existing columns.

## Analysis Queries:

Analyzes sales data by various factors like city, branch, product line, month, etc.
Calculates metrics like total revenue, average ratings, VAT per customer type, etc.
Uses conditional logic to categorize product lines based on average sales.

## Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine.
